cwm for Debian
--------------

I have renamed the executable from 'cwm' to 'openbsd-cwm' to avoid a conflict.
The man page is also renamed to openbsd-cwm.1.

The default 'lock' program bound to CM-Delete has been changed from 'xlock'
to 'xscreensaver-command -lock'. In order for this to work, you will have to
start xscreensaver, for example in your .xsession file. You can change this
setting in your configuration - see cwmrc(5).
